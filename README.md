# Flutter Greeting

This is a demo I made while learning more about https://flutter.dev/.

See https://bta199.github.io/fluttergreeting/ to give it a try!

## Build/Run/Develop

See https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install for more information.

Updating the Github pages site is currently a manual process (lazy I know!). Build the project with 

```flutter build web --release --web-renderer html --base-href /fluttergreeting/```

then copy the relevant files into the docs folder.
